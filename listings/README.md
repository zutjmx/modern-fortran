Code listings for [Modern Fortran: Building Efficient Parallel Applications](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran?a_aid=modernfortran&a_bid=2dc4d442).

## Getting started

To build and run the examples on your local machine, get the code using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/modern-fortran/listings
cd listings
make -k
```

-k
: continue to `make` even if one command fails (for those that don't have `caf` compiler wrapper, for example).

or, you can select to make particular programs by:
```sh
make array_copy_mpi
```

### Linux
Get the `mpif90` compiler wrapper on Ubuntu &ge; 12.04:
```sh
apt install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin gfortran 
```

Get the `caf` compiler wrapper on Ubuntu &ge; 17.04:
```sh
apt install open-coarrays-bin
```

### Mac
```sh
brew install gcc open-mpi
```

## Run

```sh
mpirun -n 2 ./array_copy_mpi
```
